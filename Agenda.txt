➡️Validate the Demo Agenda IntelliJ plugin
------------------------------------------
🟢 Click the Gutter Icon on this line.
🟢 Use the Ctrl + Alt + 🔽 (macOS: ⌥ + ⌘ + 🔽) shortcut when the cursor is on the line.
🟢 Observe how the plugin behaves when this single instruction intentionally stretches far beyond the editor’s right edge, forcing soft wraps to kick in and turning one logical line into several visual rows; does the action respect the logical line boundary rather than the wrapped fragments, does it keep caret movement deterministic when glyph widths vary due to ligatures, emojis (🔽, ⌘), and mixed scripts, and does it avoid splitting grapheme clusters or surrogate pairs; now imagine there are multiple carets, folded regions above and below, inlays from inspections, and a margin guide at column 120: does the shortcut still toggle consistently, coalesce undo operations sensibly, and debounce rapid key repeats so the agenda state remains predictable; try with horizontal scrolling disabled, then enabled; try inside an injected language fragment or a read‑only file; insert tabs and spaces in odd places, enable virtual space at line end, and increase the editor zoom so high‑DPI scaling and line height changes stress hit‑testing; with word wrap on, place the caret at the end of a visual row and press the shortcut repeatedly—does the plugin apply to the same logical line every time, even as soft wraps reflow due to window resizing; collapse and expand code folds, switch themes, toggle ligatures, paste an extremely long URL without breakpoints, then run the shortcut again: does the marker alignment persist, do selections remain intact, is the behavior identical across Windows, macOS, and Linux keymaps; finally, hold the keys to simulate rapid repeats and confirm the command stays idempotent, fast, and free of flicker, regardless of wrap; test with block (column) selection mode engaged and with sticky selections, verify caret shapes (block, bar, underline) don’t affect hit‑testing, and confirm IME composition windows, bidirectional text (RTL/LTR), zero‑width joiners, non‑breaking spaces, and mixed normalization forms (NFC/NFD) never confuse the action; switch file encodings between UTF‑8, UTF‑16LE, and ISO‑8859‑1, toggle CRLF vs LF line endings, and ensure undo/redo groups remain compact; measure responsiveness on massive files with thousands of wrapped characters, power‑save mode on, soft‑wrap indent enabled, and rendering throttled—does the toggle remain O(1) per invocation; open print preview, activate screen reader support, enable distraction‑free mode, and resize the window repeatedly so reflow occurs mid‑gesture; the behavior should stay consistent, crash‑free, and atomic, preserving caret positions and selections while keeping visual decorators and gutter markers perfectly aligned across themes and DPI scales.
